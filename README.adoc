= flask-desktop-app

A template for creating a simple desktop database application with Python’s _Flask_ web framework.

[CAUTION]
====
This template is configured to run only on a local machine (__i.e.__ on __localhost__), using the built-in _Flask_ development web server.
It does not make use of any authentication, and *should not be exposed to the Internet* (with __Apache__, __etc.__) without first making substantial configuration changes.
====

== Why?

Using robust and well-maintained tools such as __Python__, __SQLite__, and _SQLAlchemy_ is a good way rapidly to create a small desktop database application.
Making use of _Flask_ and _Flask-Admin_ is a perfect way to create, with minimal effort, a graphical interface for basic ‘CRUD’ (__create__, __read__, __update__, and __delete__) functions.
And leveraging __SQLAlchemy__’s powerful ORM (‘object-relational mapping’) gives you easy access to your data as Python objects: just add other Python libraries to manipulate, visualize, and otherwise use your data to achieve your goals.

== Getting Started

[IMPORTANT]
====
Python, along with its package manager __Pip__, must be installed on your system.
This will be the case for macOS and any popular modern Linux distribution.
Python is not installed on _Windows 10_ by default, but can easily be installed in several ways, including:

* from the _Microsoft Store_ (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* via the _Anaconda_ distribution (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
* via the _Windows Subsystem for Linux_ (__WSL__)
====

. Move to a directory (folder) in which you want to work, and clone this repository from __GitHub__:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/jon3191/flask-desktop-app.git
----

. Move into the new project directory:
+
[source,bash]
----
cd flask-desktop-app
----

. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
+
On macOS and Linux:
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m venv db_app_env
source db_app_env/bin/activate
----
+
NOTE: On __Windows__, use `py` instead of `python3`.
+
TIP: Virtual environments allow you to install Python packages just for a particular project, without installing them system-wide (which might interfere with your system tools or other Python projects).

. Install the Python packages:
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install -r requirements.txt
----
+
TIP: This installs the required Python packages, such as __Flask__, in the virtual environment.

. Run the example application:
+
[source,bash]
----
python run.py
----

This will create a SQLite database file called `example_app_01.db`, create some sample records in it, and start the _Flask_ development web server on your system.
If you then open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ you should the example desktop database application.

== What Next?

To create your own data models, you will need to edit the files `example_app_01/models.py` and `example_app_01/admin.py`.
The `Author` model (in `models.py`) and its presentation in the Admin (`admin.py`) is very basic, using mostly the default options.
The `Book` model demonstrates a greater number of Admin options.
You will also need either:

. to edit the sample data in `example_app_01/data_fixtures.py` to match your new models, or
. to remove the `recreate_db` function from `data_fixtures.py` and in the file `run.py` comment out the line `add_data_fixtures()` (__i.e.__ add a `#` in front of it).

After doing this, you can simply delete the database file (`example_app_01/example_app_01.db`), and re-run `python run.py` in the terminal.
This will recreate the database file using your new models.

== Model Migrations

Also included is https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Migrate[Flask-Migrate], a _Flask_ extension which is helpful for database transformations when you already have data in your database which you want to keep, but want to make changes to your data models.

Before you can run any _Flask_ or _Flask-Migrate_ commands in the terminal, _Flask_ has to know what your your application’s executable file is.
Tell it this by exporting the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

[source,bash]
----
export FLASK_APP=run.py
----

Then you can enable migrations with:

[source,bash]
----
flask db init
----

This will add a `migrations` directory to the application.

NOTE: This will also create the database file if it doesn’t already exist.

You can then generate an initial migration file with:

[source,bash]
----
flask db migrate
----

And apply the migration to the database with:

[source,bash]
----
flask db upgrade
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
The migration file will not detect every change you could possibly make to your models.
In particular, it can’t detect indexes.
====

You must repeat this `migrate` and `upgrade` command sequence whenever you make any change to the models, to make sure that the database file remains in sync with the models.

The _Flask-Migrate_ documentation is https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/[here].
